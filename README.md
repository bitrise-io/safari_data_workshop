This is a sample application

- reading a CSV table
- loading data to PostgreSQL database
- reading data from PostgreSQL database
- predicting employee attrition with tree classifiers.

Please update connection in config.ini.

Source of sample data:
https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/

You can deploy it to Heroku following these instructions:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#deploy-the-app

But the application is not set to read and predict new records!
